1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,270
Now the next step is to create a bunch of authentication enhancements, especially 

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,630
registration, the view and links. So what we'll do is we'll find number nine 

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,120
So let's come and have a look at the changes. If we go into configuration, we can 

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,480
see there's a change to the routes, and we didn't look at some of the routes from 

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,420
earlier as well. So we've got the resource registration session and passwords in 

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,740
place. We've also got 

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,490
three pages that we added earlier. If we come up to application and look within models, 

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:37,540
there's a modification to the user. So we've now got validation going on on the email 

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,110
address. 

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,800
A new registrations page has been created, 

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,810
and a new registration link has been added to the session. 

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,00
So now we'll be able to register a new user. 

13
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,510
we have the registrations controller. There's a new and a create method here. And 

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,820
if we have a brief look on the application controller, we can see now there's a current 

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,770
user that we can access 

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,200
let's test the register. We'll click on here and we'll put in appydave@appydave.com. 

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,850
click Register. 

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,700
it has registered successfully. I don't know that we'll be able to sign in yet. Let's 

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,890
just try that. So we appear to be signed in, but we got no information about the 

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,370
user. 

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,550
I would like to put that on the authentication page. 

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,170
Now to visualize the user we'll press number ten which is authentication information. 

23
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,140
We've got a new page. If we do a refresh we now have the idea of what the user is. 

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,430
But there's something missing here because you would have noticed that we did register.

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,610
So to give a little bit of clarity around this authentication model, what we have 

26
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:46,450
done is allow unauthenticated access. So it's basically skipping the require action. 

27
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:52,930
And we can see that going on here. It said for authentication page we don't need 

28
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,230
to be authenticated. But that doesn't mean you've got access to the authentication 

29
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:01,330
information. And the authentication information we're interested in is here in the 

30
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:07,630
current session which is looking in the session store. So we need to call this resume 

31
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:13,420
session. So what we can do is come back here and just say before action resume session 

32
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,730
for that particular page. Now we'll hit save on that. Come back to the authentication 

33
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,530
details and we'll refresh. 

34
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,830
now that user that we registered appydave@appydave.com is visible.

35
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,680
a recompile of the assets is giving us the sign out button. Let's see if that's working. 

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,460
We'll click on it. 

37
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:37,250
Let's try and sign back in appydave@appydave.com we'll click sign in. We'll click 

38
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,160
on the authentication page. And there we have it.

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,480
Let's now see if we can add email validation to the sign up process. So we'll go 

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,860
to the register user. 

41
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,290
to try with appydave2. Now before we run that we're going to 

42
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,500
authentication email. 

43
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,160
what we've done is add a new table to the database.

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,390
So the main changes are that the confirmation token and confirmed that have been 

45
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,970
added to the users. And then after that we've got some extra methods, plus the ability 

46
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,930
to send an email and regenerate a token.

47
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,220
Additionally, we've got the registrations. Controller now has a confirm button on 

48
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:21,220
it. We've got a user mailer with the ability to take the email. If we go into routes, 

49
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,750
we've got letter opener because that's been added via the gem. 

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,820
an important thing to think about is with the configuration, the default URL options 

51
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,220
change it to the same port as whatever your web server is running on. So let's go 

52
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,820
test it out.

53
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,580
Now we're back at the registration where we've got AP Dave two. We'll click Register 

54
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,950
and it looks like it's come up with an email system. Let's click on this. Confirm 

55
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,610
the account. 

56
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,530
we are now confirmed. So we should be able to sign in with that. There's now also 

57
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,550
a check email. If we click on that that'll take us over to letter opener. Now we 

58
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:01,860
don't need to do that because we've already done it using the default viewer. But 

59
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,760
if we go and click on the authentication page, it won't say that we're signed in 

60
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,710
just yet. So let's just click on the sign in and we'll put in appydave2 And we'll 

61
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,00
do that one more time. 

62
00:04:12,00 --> 00:04:17,470
now we can get to the account page which wasn't available before. If we look at the 

63
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,430
authentication page we can see that we're signed in correctly.

64
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,100
