1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,490
the next step is to generate the new authentication system that comes with rails 

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:09,770
eight. Now we could run step number seven which would do the rails generate authentication 

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,960
and update the database. But let's have a look at this manually. So firstly I'm just 

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,870
going to run rails generate authentication. 

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,300
we can see the new files come in. Now notice there's also an update database. If 

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,220
we go and have a look at what that's really doing. It's just a rails DB migrate and 

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,590
a rails DB test prepare. So let's run them manually as well. So just running the 

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,270
rails db migrate to update the database. The test prepare will make sure that the 

9
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,280
test database is in sync as well.

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,980
heading over to the application, let's have a look at what's changed. So if we go 

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,830
into the database migrations we can see there's a new table being added called users. 

12
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:55,890
It's got an email address and a password digest. After that we've got the sessions 

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,290
for each time a user signs in with just their IP address and user agent.

14
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,330
heading over to the app folder. There's a lot of changes going on here. 

15
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,150
we'll look at the views. We've got the passwords, email and new. There's also a mailer. 

16
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,930
So when we send out an email for resets that'll be there. 

17
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,850
we've also got the new sessions view going on here. 

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,320
everything's been done using tailwind CSS.

19
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:26,160
A simple little mailer has been created for resetting the password, and then we start 

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,750
looking at the data going on with the models. So the first one would be the user 

21
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,650
it's got has secure password and has many sessions. It's also down casing the email 

22
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,600
address. Then after that we've got the session which is belonging to a user. And 

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,490
if you want to access the current user in session, we've got this current attribute 

24
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,830
set up with the session and a delegation through to the user. Let's now go have a 

25
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,540
look at the controller, where a lot of extra work is happening in the passwords controller 

26
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,220
and the session controller.

27
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,600
Now you can see on the passwords controller. This allowed unauthenticated access 

28
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,100
and if we go to sessions, it's also got the same thing set up for the new and the 

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,980
create action here. And to find that we can go to the application controller where 

30
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,230
it's including a concept called authentication. And this is a new concern being built 

31
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,590
here. 

32
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,310
so the bulk of the code going on for the authentication system can be found in this 

33
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,880
concern.

34
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,970
Now let's go and see how this is affecting the web application. So we've got the 

35
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,430
authentication concern. It's now included automatically on the application controller. 

36
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,590
And both the home controller and the pages controller have been left the way they 

37
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,810
are now if we head over to the website and this is what we saw before, if I do a 

38
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,410
refresh, we now get taken to a sign in page. 

39
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,430
should be happening for everything.

40
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,460
So let's start by just putting in a username and password. We haven't registered 

41
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,110
it yet and we'll see what happens. 

42
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,780
Now we get to see a valid error message coming up here. But the other good thing 

43
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:08,710
is the alert message that we styled with tailwind CSS earlier is now coming through.

44
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,890
I want to relax some of the security, the home and the about page don't need to be 

45
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,230
locked down. The account page does, and the authentication page should show information 

46
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,230
about whether the user is signed in or not.

47
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,610
So I'm pressing number eight for relax. 

48
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,420
we can see there's a change to the home controller and the pages controller. If we 

49
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:35,240
do a refresh and the home page now allows us through, let's go have a look at what's 

50
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,550
going on in the pages controller. So the home controller has allow unauthenticated 

51
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,320
access, which is why we were able to get to that page with the pages controller. 

52
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,500
We've got this concept of allow unauthenticated access only for two of the particular 

53
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,560
pages. So let's just save that and we'll see what happens if we click on the about 

54
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,760
and the authentication there. Good. And we're still locked down for the account.
