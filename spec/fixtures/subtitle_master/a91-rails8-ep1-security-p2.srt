1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,750
So we'll just restart the server with the run command and refresh. And we have rails 

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,380
eight basic auth. And we can see that there's some tailwind CSS 

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,300
Giving it a little bit of styling.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,820
Now, a quick look at what we've generated is a standard controller called home with 

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,320
index. We're skipping routes because we want to use the route for this, and we can 

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,390
see just a slight modification to the routes. And here's the HTML that's going on. 

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,880
So we've got this in place here a standard view has been created and we've got a 

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,760
couple of specs. So we've got this home helper. We've got a request spec and we've 

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,250
got this view spec. Now I'm going to get rid of the view specs. 

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,140
but request specs we will look at, especially when we're doing the authentication.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,290
Now I'll just bring the terminal into focus. I'm running guard and we'll run the 

12
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:55,870
tests. And we've got one that's just been skipped, and we've got one that's in error. 

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,390
the one that's being skipped, which is a helper I'm also going to remove. And let's 

14
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,450
have a look at the request spec. 

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,180
you can see here that it's home slash index. Now I've gone and changed the route 

16
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,670
so that the home index will point to the route. So let's just make sure we change 

17
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,900
it here and we'll hit save. 

18
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,760
And now we have a working request spec for the root.

19
00:01:18,00 --> 00:01:22,990
Let's now play around with the layout. We'll get a menu in place for the authentication 

20
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,880
system. We'll also look at alert messages. So we have all this code going on for 

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,780
the different menus that we want to do. We've got a little bit of changes to the 

22
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,270
layout, especially adding in the menu. 

23
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,760
in the next step we'll work with the flash messages where they'll just use tailwind 

24
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,810
CSS to style them.

25
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,310
We'll head over to the web, 

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,290
firstly run the layout and we'll just see how things change with that. 

27
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,910
this time for the flash messages, which is number four. 

28
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,180
if we come and do a refresh, we can see the layout in place. The flash messages will 

29
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,260
show up a bit later.

30
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,130
one of the things I was encountering is that the asset precompilation doesn't happen 

31
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,460
automatically, and there should be a little bit of styling here. 

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,440
rerun the web server. It's also going to do the asset precompile. 

33
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,380
if we do a refresh we get a new look and feel.

34
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,630
Next I want to generate a few controller pages, but before I do that, I'm going to 

35
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,180
modify a few of the settings going on here, and then we'll add in the pages and the 

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,770
controllers here.

37
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:30,430
I want to generate three top level pages for the authentication system. But before 

38
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:35,530
we do that, I would like to play around with the configuration of the generator. 

39
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,630
So we'll make these changes followed by the generation of the pages. 

40
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,410
we can firstly do the application settings, 

41
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,550
we'll restart the generator and we'll do the top level pages. Number six. 

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,560
now we've got our pages controller. There's three actions ready to go. If we look 

43
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,160
in the views, we've got some pages being pre-created for us. 

44
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,110
We've also got the shared information from the flash messages and the menus that 

45
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,400
we just created earlier. If we look down at the unit tests, 

46
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,240
You'll see that it's now only generating the request spec. So if we click on that, 

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,730
there should be three in place ready to go.

48
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,430
Let's just head over to the terminal and put in a guard, and we'll see if these three 

49
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,860
request specs are running okay. They are, 

50
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,740
come over to the web view and we refresh and we can see there's now three pages available. 

51
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,230
you see any styling issues, just restart the server. I know that this should be a 

52
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,460
darker color. 

53
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,920
if we click on them, we should be able to go to the three different pages that we 

54
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,200
want to test with the security system.
